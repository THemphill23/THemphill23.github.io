                    <h3>Summary</h3>

                    I got my Nintendo 64 at a young age and was hooked on video games and technology. 
                    I wanted to know how everything worked. In high school and college I pursued learning 
                    more about technology and visual mediums. In 2012 I got a computer animation degree. I am 
                    currently a Full Stack Developer at We Can Code It with four years of professional experience. 
                    I am proficient in C#, HTML, CSS, MVC, JavaScript, and Autodesk Maya and will be certified in 
                    December, 2019. My hobbies include video games, movies, television, comics, 
                    and Dungeons and Dragons.
